#  Programs of Alfred Pan

I wrote these programs to help with **calculations** (e.g. [Euler Method.py]( https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/python/Euler%20Method.py), [Statistic Number.py](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/python/Statistic%20Number.py), and [Regression Function.py](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/python/Regression%20Function.py)) and **class affairs** (e.g. [Random Group.py](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/python/Random%20Group.py), used to help randomly divide our class into groups during group discussion). [Image Recognition.py](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/python/Image%20Recognition.py) and [Basketball Launcher.ino](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/Arduino/Basketball%20Launcher.ino) are the **image recognition** mechanism and the **main control system** used in the basketball launcher project, respectively

[Java](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/tree/master/java) programs are written to understand the concepts in my **AP Computer Science A** class

The [WeChat](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/tree/master/WeChat) program is the “*WeChat mini program*” version of the database we created in our China Thinks Big project. The **.wxss** files is the same as **.css** files.

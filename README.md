# Programs of Alfred Pan

I wrote these programs to help with **calculations** and **class affairs**

[BasketballLauncher.ino](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/Arduino/BasketballLauncher.ino) is the **main control system** used to control the launch of the ball in the basketball launcher project

[BinarySearch.java](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/java/BinarySearch.java) and [LinearSearch.java](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/java/LinearSearch.java) are two of the commonly used **search algorithms**

[BMI.java](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/java/BMI.java) is a tool I created to calculate one's **BMI value** if his/her height and weight are entered

[Circle.java](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/java/Circle.java) can calculate the **area of a circle** if the radius is entered

[GuessNumber.java](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/java/GuessNumber.java) is a **mini game** for the user to guess a random number generated by the computer with instructions of whether the guessed number is bigger or smaller than the generated one.

[InsertionSort.java](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/java/InsertionSort.java) and [SelectionSort.java](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/java/SelectionSort.java) are two of the commonly used methods to **sort a list of numbers**

[TwoDimentionalArray.java](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/java/TwoDimentionalArray.java) is used to help others better understand the concept of two dimensional array in Java by generating shapes of asterisks using two dimensional arrays

[ImageRecognition.py](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/python/ImageRecognition.py) is the **image recognition** mechanism used to detect the player in the basketball launcher project

[RandomGroup.py](https://github.com/Subways-Sun/myProgram/blob/master/python/RandomGroup.py) is used to help randomly divide our class into groups during group discussion.
